**Stroke Prediction**

Stroke (also called brain attack) is second leading cause of death, according to WHO. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke.
Dataset used to analysis, contains information whether patient had stroke, and their health conditions parameters like BMI or age. Each row represents state of one patient. Analysis is meant to predict stroke. 

During analysis I used:
* Jupiter Notebook
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn

Project allowed me to improve my ML skill, practice above python libraries and learn how to deal with imbalanced dataset using SMOTE.  

Dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
